The entropy weight calculation software, aiming to support research in the field of sustainability assessment. The software is applicable to specific scenarios of composite indices methods, including time series data, cross-sectional data, and panel data, providing extensive applicability for various types of studies. Developed using the C# programming language and based on the .NET platform, the software features multiple interactive modes to meet diverse needs in sustainability assessment. By customizing the indicator system and applying the entropy weight method to different data scenarios, the software can generate entropy weights and scores for each indicator, sub-dimension, and dimension. 

Software required: The installation and use of this software require a Windows operating system and version 4.7.2 or above of the NET framework.
